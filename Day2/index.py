# Addition (+): Adds two operands.

a = 10
b = 20
result = a + b
print(result)  # Output: 30


# Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.

a = 30
b = 15
result = a - b
print(result)  # Output: 15


# Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.

a = 5
b = 6
result = a * b
print(result)  # Output: 30


# Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand (always results in a float).

a = 20
b = 3
result = a / b
print(result)  # Output: 6.666666666666667


# Modulus (%): Returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand.

a = 20
b = 3
result = a % b
print(result)  # Output: 2


# Floor Division (//): Performs division and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

a = 20
b = 3
result = a // b
print(result)  # Output: 6


# Exponentiation ()**: Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

a = 2
b = 3
result = a ** b
print(result)  # Output: 8
